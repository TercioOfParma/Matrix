This (if you have run it you can tell) is a small demo that allows you to create screen effects similar to those in the movie.
There is little else to it than it is a semi-cool text screensaver to run if you leave your terminal.

./matrix <char range>

The char range allows you to limit to charaters between this and 127, which is the last value on the ASCII table(on many sites
and google images).

This will compile on anything running an operating system that supports a form of curses past Unix System V(mid 1980s), although
some modifications are required in order to compile on anything that is Linux or similar *nix supporting ncurses.

All you have to do is change the #include <ncurses.h> to <curses.h> and have curses installed If running *nix or if you have
pdcurses installed on windows or MS-DOS. 

The command to compile is the following on Linux or modern *nix:

gcc	-o	matrix	main.c	-lncurses

On older *nix:

cc	-o	natrix	main.c	-lcurses

On windows with gcc (if you use visual studio stop using it, and you will also need pdcurses.dll in the directory with the exec):

gcc	-o	matrix	main.c	-lpdcurses

NOTE: you need to have either pdcurses, ncurses or curses for the compilation for this to work. If you want a binary for raspberry
pi but cannot be bothered to compile please private message me on YouTube
